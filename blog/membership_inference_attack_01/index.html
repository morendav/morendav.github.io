Machine learning is a rapidly evolving field with the potential to revolutionize many aspects of our lives. It is already being used in a wide range of applications: from healthcare to finance to transportation. As machine learning continues to evolve, it is likely to become even more pervasive in our lives. These ML models are often trained on large datasets of data, which can include sensitive information.</p><p>As a result, the importance of machine learning is not just limited to its potential to improve our lives. It also has the potential to impact our privacy in significant ways.
"</p><h1 id=privacy--machine-learning class=anchor-link><a href=#privacy--machine-learning>Privacy & Machine Learning</a></h1><p>Machine learning algorithms have become ubiquitous across products we use everyday, these algorithms attempt to generalize while necessarily being trained on a subset of all possible examples.</p><h2 id=ml-basics--intuition class=anchor-link><a href=#ml-basics--intuition>ML Basics & Intuition</a></h2><p>This post is by no means an introduction to ML, there are much more skilled teachers that deliver the content in many forms of media - in particular I have enjoyed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHZwWFHWa-w">3Blue1Brown’s series on YouTube</a>. Some (simplified) basics for this post will do:</p><p><strong>Generalizability</strong></p><p>Consider a classification task: an algorithm that is trained to output one of two labels (cat or dog) using images of dogs and cats as input. If this model is trained on all sorts of cats but only large dog breeds, then we can expect it to do well on images of all sorts of cats and only large breed dogs. Even without training, this model has pretty good odds of making the correct call, a 50/50 chance of making the correct prediction without having any trained ability to differentiate dogs and cats.</p><p>Let’s say that after multiple epochs of training this same model is then tasked with classifying an image of a small breed dog that it has never seen: it may predict <em>Dog</em> with low confidence or worse… predict <em>Cat</em>.</p><p>This intuitive example reveals a little bit about how machines are capable of learning: the model attempts to “remember” a mapping from the inputs it has seen in the training data to the outputs, or the correct labels. In doing so, the model is able to map what it has seen during training to the output classes available (dog, cat). When presented with a new variant of a class <em>it has seen</em> then this mapping may not serve the model well.</p><p><strong>Overfitting</strong></p><p>Continuing this classification task example, the model is trained by:</p><ol><li>Being shown a picture as input (dog, cat)</li><li>Calculating the output prediction, by cascading neuron activations throughout it’s layers</li><li>Comparing it’s prediction against the true value, calculating it’s error</li><li>Using back propagation alchemy to tune it’s model weights and biases to better predict that specific example</li></ol><p>Rinse, repeat for all samples, repeat that over multiple epochs of training.</p><p>By following this procedure our classification model develops from an interconnected network of random parameters to a set of tuned parameters for its task. In general, many arbitrary ML algorithms follow this pattern: a simple regression algorithm begins with a series of random parameters and a deep neural network begins with random weights for each of its neurons and random biases for each of its connections. The process of training the model slowly tunes the <em>trainable parameters</em> of the model to fit its task based on the training examples that are used.</p><p>Coming back to the training process… Let’s imagine this cycle runs indefinitely - repeatedly the model is exposed to those images of all sorts of cats and only large dogs. The same pictures of all sorts of cats, and only large breed dogs. Again. And again. And again.</p><p>We can expect that as this cycle approaches the end of time said model would get <em>really good</em> at identifying cats and large breed dogs. That is, the model would get very skilled at predicting <strong><em>THOSE</em></strong> all sorts of cats and <strong><em>THOSE</em></strong> large breed dogs it had seen in its training data (over and over and over and…)</p><p>After each cycle of calculating losses and back propagating them through its parameters this model will <strong>overfit</strong> to the training data. In other words, the process will optimize the model’s trainable parameters to be very accurate for predicting data in it’s training dataset but will plateau or even develop this heightened accuracy at the expense of its ability to predict data outside of it’s training dataset.</p><h2 id=what-this-tells-us-about-how-machines-learn class=anchor-link><a href=#what-this-tells-us-about-how-machines-learn>What this tells us about how machines learn</a></h2><p>Somewhere inside a trained model, within its weights and biases, this machine must retain some imprint or memory of the data it’s seen during its training. In general, models tend to perform better on samples from its training dataset, and if a model is overfit then this characteristic becomes exaggerated. The hope is that this model would generalize beyond the samples it had seen during training to new samples observed in the wild, but nonetheless its capabilities are learned during the training process.</p><p>This exploration of a model’s training and memory has profound implications for models trained on sensitive data, and especially in cases where even being a member of the training dataset reveals some sensitive characteristics about an individual.</p><p>Let’s consider a more complicated model, a classification algorithm that predicts between a finite set of theparies for a cancer patient given some data points about the patient. If an attacker has access to an individual’s data and is able to deduce the patient’s participation in the training dataset then de facto the attacker has learned that this individual has cancer and the patient’s health privacy is violated.</p><p>For such an attack, the attacker wouldn’t need access to a model&rsquo;s parameters, instead the attacker would only need to have access to the model’s predictions. This is the privacy vulnerability of a model that a Membership Inference Attack exploits.</p><h1 id=measuring-privacy-of-ml-models-mia class=anchor-link><a href=#measuring-privacy-of-ml-models-mia>Measuring Privacy of ML Models: MIA</a></h1><h4 id=mia_intro class=anchor-link><a href=#mia_intro></a></h4><p>Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) were introduced by Shokri et al. <sub><cite><sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup></cite></sub> in 2017, and much of the research since its introduction has focused on improving the attack’s efficiency or proposing alternative methods to measure the same memorization tendencies of a model but the essence of the assessment remains the same: given a model and a datapoint, predict whether that datapoint was part of the model’s training dataset.</p><p>Let’s explore two MIA approaches:</p><h2 id=1---membership-inference-shadow-model-approach class=anchor-link><a href=#1---membership-inference-shadow-model-approach>1 - Membership Inference: Shadow Model Approach</a></h2><h4 id=mia_intro_shadowmodel class=anchor-link><a href=#mia_intro_shadowmodel></a></h4><p>Earlier, our hypothetical model classified an image as being a member of one of two possible classes: Cat or Dog.</p><p>Now we are posed with a question that also has a binary outcome: this datapoint <em><span style=text-decoration:underline>was in</span></em> or this datapoint <em><span style=text-decoration:underline>was not in</span></em> the training dataset used to train the target model. This classification task is well suited for another ML model that we will use as the attacker model.</p><p>This first MIA approach trains an attacker classification model to predict one of two possible outcomes (was in, was not in) for each class (in our example: cat, dog). This procedure is more involved, requiring more computation than the alternative because this method requires training multiple shadow ML models whose characteristics are similar to the target model we are attacking. This method also requires access to a known dataset that is similar to the target model&rsquo;s training dataset, alternatively this <em>known dataset</em> may be <a href=/blog/membership_inference_attack_01/#mia_intro_shadowmodel_gendata>generated from the target model</a>. The <strong>shadow model approach</strong> at a high level involves two activities:</p><ol><li><p>Training a set of <strong>shadow models</strong> that mirror the behavior of the target model</p><ol><li>These shadow models use known samples as part of their training data</li><li>We reserve some data beyond the training data to use as validation data</li></ol></li><li><p>Training an <strong>attacker classification model</strong> on the label (was in, was not in) and the outputs of the shadow models with the task of predicting whether a given datapoint represents a sample that <span style=text-decoration:underline>was in that shadow model’s training dataset</span></p><ol><li>Since the training data for the shadow models are known, we can use these samples and the shadow models’ predictions to train our classification model to recognize model outputs on training samples</li><li>Samples from the training data fed through the shadow models are labeled as being a member, whereas samples from the validation dataset fed through the shadow models are labeled as being nonmember. These labels are the ground truth used for the attacker models prediction error and back propagation</li></ol></li></ol><p>In Shokri et al. <sub><cite><sup id=fnref1:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup></cite></sub> demonstrated successful attacks using this approach with multiple shadow models. Random sampling at the onset of each shadow model’s training added entropy to the distribution of known data points into either of the training and test datasets. Later, Salem et al <sub><cite><sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup></cite></sub> demonstrated success using a single shadow model.</p><p>This MIA approach is often referred to as closed-system, closed-box, or black box MIA because direct access to the model’s parameters is not needed; instead only the target model’s output is needed (classification predictions, predictions confidence).</p><h3 id=returning-to-our-cat-dog-example class=anchor-link><a href=#returning-to-our-cat-dog-example>Returning to our Cat-Dog example:</a></h3><p>Let us assume we have a set of known cat and dog images that we suspect is similar to the training data that was used to train the target model. These are the known images we will use to train our shadow models. Of this set of known samples, we split the images into a set of training and validation samples within each class, making sure that [cat, dog] are roughly equally represented in each of our split populations.</p><p>Next, we train a <strong>shadow model</strong> that predicts cat or dog based on samples from our training data split.</p><p>We repeat these steps such that we have a set of <strong>shadow models</strong>, taking care to randomly assign data points to each model&rsquo;s training dataset and validation dataset differently for each new <strong>shadow model</strong> we train.</p><p>Next, we train the <strong>attacker classification model</strong> to predict one of [was in, was not in] labels.</p><p>To train the attacker model we present the shadow model with an image from its training dataset, use the model output as a feature for the attacker’s training data, and finally label that example as ‘was in’.</p><p>Repeat this process for samples from that <strong>shadow model’s</strong> validation dataset (thus being outside of the shadow’s training data set), except the feature label for these samples are ‘was not in’</p><p>By following this methodology the <strong>attacker model</strong> is able to predict one of [was in, was not in] given a set of [model predictions, prediction metadata] generated by the <strong>shadow models</strong>. This process is repeated, training the same attacker model using the set of different shadow models to improve its ability to predict one of [was in, was not in] labels.</p><p>An <strong>attacker model</strong> is created in this way for each class in the output space.</p><h3 id=generating-in-distribution-training-data class=anchor-link><a href=#generating-in-distribution-training-data>Generating in-distribution training data</a></h3><h4 id=mia_intro_shadowmodel_gendata class=anchor-link><a href=#mia_intro_shadowmodel_gendata></a></h4><p>In this hypothetical cat-dog example, we assume that we have access to a dataset that is (a) similar to the dataset used to train the target model and (b) contains data similar to the target datapoint we want to infer the membership of in the target model’s training dataset.</p><p>For an experimental set up or a proof of concept these assumptions are acceptable; however, in a practical setting they may be outside of what is available to us as an attacker. What can we do if we don’t have access to such a dataset? Or what if we are not confident that our <em>known dataset</em> is similar enough to the target dataset?</p><p>It is likely that in the wild a ‘similar enough’ dataset may not be available, in this case we can take advantage of the same model characteristics that are exploited by a MIA to generate in-distribution synthetic data. In this practical setting the only thing we may have confidence in or have access to are (1) the target model and (2) the target model’s output given some input. At the foundation of the MIA privacy assessment is this intuition that our classification model’s output label confidence is high for samples that are statistically similar to the model’s training dataset. This model behavior can be used to generate a set of images that are statistically representative of each class in the training dataset, iterating through each possible class in the output space this could be implemented in a number of ways including a two step algorithm described in <sub><cite><sup id=fnref2:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup></cite></sub></p><ol><li><strong>Search</strong>: Implement a hill climbing algorithm that attempts to maximize the model output’s classification confidence<ol><li>This process begins with a random initialization of all possible data points in the input feature space</li><li>The features are randomly perturbed incrementally, and the gradient of the model’s output confidence is used to either promote to discard an iterations perturbations</li><li>This process is repeated until a threshold confidence is reached</li></ol></li><li><strong>Sampling</strong>: Once the hill-climb and incremental feature perturbations reach a threshold confidence in the model’s output, that sample is promoted to the synthetic dataset<ol><li>This is repeated with a different initialization until a sufficiently large synthetic dataset is generated</li></ol></li></ol><p>A GANs variation of this approach trains adversarial generative and discriminative models to create more data within each class where we have some data but not enough, this augmentation may be used to create more data after some initial seed synthetic data is generated using the first approach.</p><h2 id=2---membership-inference-threshold-approach class=anchor-link><a href=#2---membership-inference-threshold-approach>2 - Membership Inference: Threshold Approach</a></h2><h4 id=mia_intro_threshold class=anchor-link><a href=#mia_intro_threshold></a></h4><p>This approach builds off of the original shadow model based approach with two additional insights:</p><ol><li><p>As a shadow model’s characteristics converge on the target models they begin to overlap, in other words the most trusted shadow model is one that is an exact carbon copy of the target model</p></li><li><p>The same holds for the data we use to train the shadow models: if we have to generate our own synthetic data, the closer this becomes to mirror the original target model’s data, the better</p></li></ol><p>Here we fall back to these assertions, to simply use the target model as the shadow model and use the target model’s training and validation datasets instead of synthetic or similar datasets.</p><p>This method uses the target model’s predictions, prediction metadata (confidence, entropy, accuracy), intermediate model calculations, and ground truth labels for the data used to perform the MIA to assess the model’s capacity to memorize training examples <sub><cite><sup id=fnref:3><a href=#fn:3 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>3</a></sup></cite></sub> . These metrics are compared to a threshold value, and the algorithm counts how many data points from the training dataset and how many from the validation dataset are above the threshold values. Counting positive and negative membership predictions from both datasets (training and validation datasets) allows us to count true and false results using the ground truth memberships for positive predictions (the data point is in the training dataset) and negative predictions (the data point was not in the training dataset). Putting this together, we are able to generate a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve which represents the accuracy with which an attacker could predict membership of a datapoint in the training dataset.</p><h2 id=comparing-methods class=anchor-link><a href=#comparing-methods>Comparing methods</a></h2><p><strong><span style=text-decoration:underline>The threshold approach</span></strong> is less computationally demanding than the closed-box approach, and does not require any data generation since it uses the target model and its own training and test data to perform the MIA. Additionally, Song et al. <sub><cite><sup id=fnref1:3><a href=#fn:3 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>3</a></sup></cite></sub> assert that the alternative (neural network based) MIA methods underestimate the privacy risk of memorized training examples.</p><p>A keen privacy or security minded reader at this point may have tingling spidey senses: isn’t the harm here coming from an attacker having full access to the model and its data? If we have access to both, and have a target datapoint in mind, can’t we simply search that record in the dataset we have access to inorder to confirm membership? If we ground ourselves in the perspective of an attacker, this approach is not likely to reveal anything more valuable than what the attacker already has: the attacker would already have full open-box access to the model and have access to the entire training and validation datasets. With this grounding in mind we can conclude that this approach is useful to measure the memorization risk of a model theoretically but may not be as useful as an attack in the wild.</p><p><strong><span style=text-decoration:underline>The shadow model approach</span></strong> inherits a dependency on how faithfully the shadow models’ training and test datasets mirror the target model’s datasets, and how closely the shadow models’ characteristics mirror that of the target model. Additionally, consider that this method seeks to train a classifier model using labeled examples and shadow models predictions and predication metadata: this system’s objective is to minimize the loss of its predictions (this sample was in, or this sample was not in the target model’s training dataset).
