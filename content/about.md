## About the Site

Welcome my idea sharing site.

Around the time I launched this site, infrared radiation was recorded from the deepest pocket of space we've seen (albeit for a small slice) of our known Universe. It took in the order of 10<sup>10</sup> years for this information to reach your computer screen, I commit to posting at least more often than it has taken for this deep space to reach you :+1:

## About the Author

Greetings.

I am David, currently living in California. Here is a *pseudonymized* picture of me next to my favorite animal: an alpaca.

I enjoy spending my time learning new things, being outdoors, and spending time with my family. Discovering activities that allow for all three at the same time is the sweet spot, if you got leads on this let me know.

I'm excited to write about stuff I find interesting, & I hope others find neat too.

 Want more about me? I'll keep it short:

### Likes
* Traveling and trying new foods
* Meeting people's pets :dog: :cat:... esp. those with human names
* Music, all kinds

### Dislikes
* lists without at least one item on them

Thanks for checking out my blog / site. I hope you find some of this material educational, or at least entertaining.

Enjoy your stay.
