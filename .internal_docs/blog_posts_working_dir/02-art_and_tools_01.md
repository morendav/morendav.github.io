Topic idea: Advances in technology invite a reevaluation of the bounds of creativity and by extension human level intelligence

Core Ideas
* Developments in Technology and movements in art are inextricably linked
  * this forces a reevaluation of the bounds of what we consider creativity and art
  * the reevaluation (moving the line) in the art world, is consequential to the boundary we've drawn that separates AI from 'human level intelligence'
  * ultimately the debate is irrelevant without meaningful engagement from an observer

* art and tech
  * advances in technology mean changes in availability and accessibility of creative tooling
  * realism, and the impressionist movement
  * photography as an art and science
  * photography --> rolling pictures --> digital photography --> digital media (new media)
  * ML has long been used in digital art: from red eye reduction to background editing

* tech and creativity
  * The relationship between technology and creativity is consequential to our definition of AI
  * Seemingly the line we draw that seperates ML and true artificial intelligence has shifted overtime, as technology breached previous lines
  * Playing games
  * real time problem solving, computer vision: autonomous driving
  * the final breach may be a system that achieves creativity

  > Creativity is deeply philosophically contentious, and hinges on twin issues of randomness and understanding.
  > As we’ve discussed, computers are currently unable to create truly random data. And some people might argue that it’s that element of randomness that is itself the spark of human creativity - adding something that no-one else could or has added before. An AI cannot do that.
  > Similarly, although AI may be able to fool a human into thinking a given poem, painting, etc., was written by another human, that’s not the same as that piece of “creative art” having genuine meaning. An AI will give you an endless number of outputs based on what you put in - but it won’t understand them. It has no concept of why you should be compared to a summer’s day, other than that string of words appeared in another piece of text it analyzed. To an AI, all creative inputs and outputs are merely data.

## Research

1. AI Wins art fare
  * Midjourney AI generated art wins art fare

> “You said AI would never be as good as you, that AI would never do the work you do, and I said, ‘Oh really? How about this? I won,’” he said. “It’s here now. Recognize it. Stop denying the reality. AI isn’t going away.”

   * similar to core argument in Life3.0 around how we have bound what is and is not AI

> “a woman in a Victorian frilly dress, wearing a space helmet” — and kept fine-tuning the prompts, “using tests to really make an epic scene, like out of a dream.” He said he spent 80 hours making more than 900 iterations of the art, adding words like “opulent” and “lavish” to fine tune its tone and feel.


> The win also triggered a flood of rage online. A tweet expressing profane dismay at Allen’s win has been liked more than 85,000 times. Another person tweeted, “We’re watching the death of artistry unfold right before our eyes.”

> "technical progress in computer vision, a research area dedicated to designing algorithms that can process meaningful visual information. A subclass of computer vision algorithms, called generative models, occupies center stage in this story. Generative models are artificial neural networks that can be “trained” on large datasets containing millions of images and learn to encode their statistically salient features.

2. Impressionist art were not considered high art- there has been and continbues to be a hot debate about _what is art_
   * Claude Monet: "Claude Monet’s Impression, Sunrise (Musée Marmottan Monet, Paris) exhibited in 1874, gave the Impressionist movement its name when the critic Louis Leroy accused it of being a sketch or “impression,” not a finished painting. " source: https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/imml/hd_imml.htm

   * premixed paints in tubes enabled 'En Plein Air' painting
    * pre-impressionists used open air painting as a prep for studio painting, where the mastered








## Themes

Art & technology continuously push a line

Tension between concept and conservatism
* " a purist painter of earlier times might shun the modern purist painter for the simple act of purchasing pre-made paints. They might bemoan that they didn't make their own pigments and mix up their own paints. "
* art adapts to current tooling / technology
  * Realism and technique were the pinnacle of art world
  * impressionism flipped this script, shifted focus to representation and abstraction
  * soon film entered, and classical tool backed art making adapted (abstract expressionism, fauvism, cubism, etc) <-- check timing
  * film resisted digitization
  * digitization resisted smart editing and creativity studios

  Tech in art:
    * from organic paints --> synthetic paints
    * ... to premixed paints and mass manufactored paint tubes
    * from film photography --> rolling pictures
      --> digital photography and film making
      --> digital media editing software





Impressionism Art
  * impressionism flipped this script, shifted focus to abstract representation
  * was a reaction to evolution in artistic tooling (portable, premixed paints)

  > American John Rand never joined their ranks as a preeminent artist, but as a painter living in London, he designed in 1841 a device that would revolutionize the art world: paint in a tube. His clever new technology offered easily portable, pre-mixed paint, and allowed painters to bring their process outdoors.
  > Rand’s technological leap allowed spontaneity and a casual quality to the work of Impressionists. Over time, other artists joined in the practice, and their exploration together moved from indoor studios to outdoor cafes, with regular get-togethers to discuss their ideas.
  > Realist painter Edouard Manet was part of this crowd and is often referred to as an Impressionist because of his early influence on and close friendships with the members of the movement. The Impressionists took many of Manet’s techniques to heart, particularly his embrace of modernity as subject matter and the spontaneity of his brush strokes, along with his use of color and lighting. All these qualities are displayed in his 1863 painting Le Dejeuner sur l’Herbe.

Photography & Art
  * photography was a democratizing force (portraits no longer only for wealthy)

  * was contested as an art form
    * source: https://theconversation.com/how-photography-evolved-from-science-to-art-37146
    "Oddly enough, it was not always this way. Photography has not yet celebrated its 200th birthday, yet in the medium’s first century of existence, there was a great deal of debate over its artistic merit. "

  * (photography) hotly debated both if photography was an art form, and if the practice was a science
    * SOURCE: https://www.nga.gov/features/in-light-of-the-past/the-19th-century-the-invention-of-photography.html

  * Photography as Art
    *  Pictorialist movement: maniuplation of negatives to make the photograph look more 'paint like'
    * to be taken seriously as an art form
    >> "Pictorialist photographers manipulated the negative by hand; they used multiple negatives and masking to create a single print (much like compositing in Photoshop today); they applied soft focus and new forms of toning to create blurry and painterly effects; and they rejected the mechanical look of the standard photograph. Essentially, they sought to push the boundaries of the form to make photographs appear as “painting-like” as possible – perhaps as a way to have them taken seriously as art."

      * this is similar to AI Generated art with prompts like 'painting of a landscape in the style of X' where X = [some artists, e.g. monet]

    >>  "Still, well into the 20th century, many critics and artists continued to view photography as operating in a realm that was not quite fine art – a debate that even continues today."

Machine made art
  * origins in mid-20th century

  > It was in the early 1980s, however, that an artist Harald Cohen with a group of engineerings invented a paint program named AARON: a robotic machine designed to make large drawings on the sheet of paper placed on the floor. Initially, the machine was creating abstract drawings, then those turned more representational over time and the machine was able to imitate shapes from nature. In the ’90s, AARON also started to implement color to the drawings. Even though Cohen was always very careful not to claim AARON’s creativity but rather his own, considering the machine just as a tool for his own expression, his program is now considered as a harbinger of what we know today as Artificial Intelligence.

  * mixing machine and human art, Cohen painted over the drawings from AARON (EX: https://direct.mit.edu/view-large/figure/3407736/leon_a_01906-F1.tif)


  END WITH

  "I think creativity is a relative term it clearly the machine is being creative the program is being creative to the degree that every time it does a drawing
it does a drawing that nobody's ever seen before including me I don't think it's currently as creative as I am in writing the program I think for a
program to be fully creative in a more complete sense creative it has to be able to modify its own performance and that's a very difficult problem"

Random ideas not fitting in:
* The lines on (AI) and (ART) both have moved
  * AI continuously moves out of reach for it's own algorithms and architectures: the last being creativity
  * Art continuously moves out in response to breaches by technology in the environment of new tooling

* (writing) Humans have always resisted new tool environments
  * Plato thought that written word and accessibility of scribe craft posed an existential threat to oral tradition, that as a consequence this posed a threat to intellectualism because it would make people lazy especially those members of academic institutions entrusted to sustain and progress human knowledge
  * That is draped in a thick irony since it is only through written works from the time that we know anything about Plato's belief on the subject

* "Computers are killing X"
  * Deep Blue beat Kasparov, accounts of people saying it would kill Chess... that hasn't happened
