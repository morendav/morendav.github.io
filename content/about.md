## About the Site

Welcome to David's idea sharing site.
Here you will find ramblings about topics like:

* privacy & cybersecurity
* ML & data science
* Neat books
* Good podcax1st recommendations
* Maybe some artwork too

*_Note: topics list is growing and subject to change_


Recently, infrared radiation was recorded from the deepest pocket of space we've seen (albeit for a small slice) of our known Universe. It took in the order of 10<sup>10</sup> years for this information to reach your computer screen, I commit to posting at least more often than it has taken for this deep space to reach you :+1:

### A note on privacy
  _... just when you thought you'd get away without some privacy talk ..._

This site uses [Google Analytics](https://support.google.com/analytics/topic/2919631?hl=en&ref_topic=1008008), I use this data to understand:
* what content my audience is engaging with (e.g. which pages are visited)
* who my audience is, in coarse terms (e.g. coarse geotag)

These data are used to measure content engagement.

This site does not
* have a subscribe feature
* have log-in's, comments, or other content submission forms
* include `referrer` in share links

This site is also [open source](https://github.com/morendav/morendav.github.io), so you can independently verify this :raised_hands:

## About the Author

Greetings.

I am David, born and raised in the [Minneapolis](https://goo.gl/maps/3Y5zo4mPiEcXe1tA6), and currently living in California.

I enjoy spending my time learning new things, spending time outdoors, and spending time with my family. Discovering activities that allow for all three at the same time is the sweet spot, if you got leads on this please let me know. Here is a fun pseudonymized pictured of myself next to an Alpaca.

In my copious amounts of free time I'm excited to bring to you some neat stuff I know.

Want more about me? I'll keep it short:

### Likes
* Traveling and trying new foods
* Meeting people's pets :dog: :cat:... esp. those with human names
* Music, all kinds

### Dislikes
* lists without at least one item on them
