Welcome my idea sharing site.

Last year, infrared radiation was [recorded from the deepest pocket we've reached](https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/goddard/2022/nasa-s-webb-delivers-deepest-infrared-image-of-universe-yet) of of our known universe. It took in the order of 10<sup>10</sup> years for this information to reach your computer screen, I commit to posting at least more often than it has taken for this deep space to reach you.
