Greetings.

I am David, currently living in California. Here is a *pseudonymized* picture of me next to my favorite animal: an alpaca.

I enjoy spending my time learning new things, being outdoors, and spending time with my family. Discovering activities that allow for all three at the same time is the sweet spot, if you got leads on this let me know. I'm excited to write about stuff I find interesting, & I hope others find neat too. Want more about me? I'll keep it short:

**Likes:**
* Traveling and trying new foods
* Meeting people's pets :dog: :cat:... esp. those with human names
* Music, all kinds

**Dislikes:**
* lists without at least one item on them
