Recently, infrared radiation was recorded from the deepest pocket of space we've seen (albeit for a small slice) of our known Universe. It took in the order of 10<sup>10</sup> years for this information to reach your computer screen, I commit to posting at least more often than it has taken for this deep space to reach you :+1:

## About the Author

Greetings.

I am David Moreno, born and raised in the [Minneapolis](https://goo.gl/maps/3Y5zo4mPiEcXe1tA6), and currently living in California.

I enjoy spending my time learning new things, spending time outdoors, and spending time with my family. Discovering activities that allow for all three at the same time is the sweet spot, if you got leads on this please let me know. Here is a fun pseudonymized pictured of myself next to an Alpaca.

In my copious amounts of free time I'm excited to bring to you some neat stuff I know.

Want more about me? I'll keep it short:

### Likes
* Traveling and trying new foods
* Meeting people's pets :dog: :cat:... esp. those with human names
* Music, all kinds

### Dislikes
* lists without at least one item on them
