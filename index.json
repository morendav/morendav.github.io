[{"content":"In this inaugural post I walk through the decision making that informed the design of this site (which tools and technologies I used), and the steps to set it all up.\nTL;DR This site is\nhosted on Firebase created using Hugo has a custom domain purchased on Google Domains Built following these steps Lessons / Key takeaways Start projects with a goal, list of requirements and constraints. Then consider the options before starting on any work. I knew I wanted to set up my own site, because I‚Äôve been wanting to learn the basics of front end dev and have a space to play around in At first, I started using Octopress for content generation then double backed to research alternatives before landing on Hugo. If I had researched first, I would have saved some time. This site is hosted on Firebase It has a free tier with plenty of headroom before I hit any price point Offers a nice runway to grow the site beyond static content, with serverless backends and plenty of plugins to try in the future For custom domains purchased on Google Domains, the ‚Äòownership check‚Äô is skipped which saves time and implementation complexity The content is generated using Hugo Hugo has an active community (reddit, discord, and thorough documentation) which is reassuring for a FE beginner It‚Äôs written in Go, which is also something on my #ToLearn list Planning the build I followed these steps to get this site up:\nStart with a goal, and list of requirements and constraints Generate the site content Find a host and custom domain First: Goals, requirements, and constraints TL;DR If you want to focus on writing, there is no need to set up your own site. Go with Medium, which is the best free-to-post site IMO.\nI had intended to learn some FE basics + start writing this year. Setting up this blog allowed me to peel two potatoes at the same time (cruelty free figures of speech only on this site üê¶ üê¶)\nGoals Find a place to host my writing Learn HTML, Javascript, and CSS basics Host in a place that allows me to link to github projects Stretch: Run code from the site itself Non-goals Build a dynamic site (\u0026hellip;yet) / build anything that would necessitate a database Requirements I‚Äôm new to front end development, so I need something that comes with a framework I can tinker with as opposed to building something from scratch The framework should come with an active community so that I can find support as needed I am not interested in opening my home network to the internet, so I‚Äôd like to host on a third party platform Preferably a free-to-host platform Constraints Time: My primary goal is to have a place to write, but my secondary goal is to learn by tinkering on my site. A tension arises here as the tinkering pulls time out of writing, and vice versa. Second, generate the content TL;DR I chose Hugo because it had the most active community for support and it‚Äôs written in Go which is a language I wanted to pick up anyway.\nI went on the hunt for static content generators, which are tools to create the html, css, and javascript that would become my site. In doing so, I found a new requirement that the site be tolerable aesthetically so a generator with an active community and support for themes was added to my list from the requirements step.\nI found this great list of site generators, from there I narrowed down to a few options based on the technologies used as well as the communities supporting the tooling:\nSite Content Options Description Comments Eleventy Open sourced Javascript static site generator Handles incremental builds Has an active Git, good documentation, and active Discord Many actively maintained plugins Requires a bit more setup for hosting on GitHub Pages \u0026 Firebase (Anecdotally) Next.js Minimalist Jamstack framework using Javascript, typescript, and rust. Objective is to build scalable React web apps (static, dynamic) Good community, popular modern framework Lack of native themes Lacks plugins (e.g. 'read time' was a feature I was after on my site) Steep learning curve compared to plug and play generators Hugo Written in Go General purpose static site framework Handles incremental builds Fastest builder (thanks Go!) Limited plugins Many community supported themes Steep learning curve to create new themes (thanks Go :frown:) but many themes already to choose from. I went with Hugo, because it offered a quick setup with plenty of room for tinkering after the initialization. It‚Äôs also written in Go which makes site building fast for quick prototyping down the road.\nThird, finding a host TL;DR I went with Firebase which offers trivial custom domain setup along with a free tier that offers plenty of headroom for the traffic and site content I plan to create.\nI considered the following for hosting - I initially published to GitHub Pages; which seemingly offered the fastest time-to-deployment since my source was in a public repo anyway, but switched to Firebase after configuring my custom domain. Firebase, I found, offered the most runway for continued development beyond static content only (no concrete plans here, but the optionality is valuable).\nHost Options Description Comments Netlify Serverless Jamstack platform. Free tier up to 300 build minutes per month. Support for web dev CI/CD Many 3P service APIs 1-click roll backs Github Pages Git repo hosting service that may run the files through a jekyll build process. Soft build limit (10/hour), and site size (1gb served, 100gb bandwidth) Git provided cert üîí Zero-config build Firebase App and rich site development platform, offers automated backend services and a suite of features for release and app measurement. Has a free tier also Zero-config SSL certs üîí Trivial setup for real-time backend 1-click roll backs GCP backed for serving at scale (GCP comes with $300 new acct credits) Impressive open-sourced bundled features NOTE: Not an exhaustive list, see more complete list here.\nFinally, getting a neat custom domain Pricing was a wash and there is no differentiator in the product offering itself (no matter the seller, you‚Äôre getting the same domain!) I went with Google Domains because when adding the custom domain in Firebase, if purchased from Google Domains then the ownership proof is done automatically which will save some time and implementation compleixty.\nNOTE: GitHub Pages threw an error when I tried to reconfigure the build to my custom domain, so I chose to relocate my site to Firebase at this point.\nBuilding it I will skip steps for hosting on GitHub Pages, which can otherwise be found here, and provide the steps I followed to host on Firebase (including setting up my custom domain name on Google Domains)\nPrerequisites: Git, Hugo, and Node.js\nbrew install git brew install hugo brew install node Setup a Github repo for the site\nCreate a repo with the naming convention [username].github.io\nI left ‚Äúmain‚Äù as the source for Hugo build and created a separate branch for the site called gh-pages NOTE: this was initially for the github pages deployment, but I kept the naming convention.\nClone the github repo locally.\nyou‚Äôll want to be working locally from the main branch Initialize Hugo in your cloned repo.\nhugo new site [username].github.io/ cd [username].github.io/ Picking a theme requires downloading \u0026amp; updating the config file. I am using PaperMod\nNOTE: PaperMod instructions use a YAML based Hugo build but I kept TOML. You can find YAML ‚Üí TOML translators online. A sample YAML config for PaperMod is here\ngit clone https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod themes/PaperMod --depth=1 configure only the contents of ./public/* (the built site) to push to the gh-pages branch mkdir .github/ .github/workflows touch .github/workflows/ Add the following content to that file:\nname: github pages on: push: branches: - main # Set a branch to deploy pull_request: jobs: deploy: runs-on: ubuntu-22.04 steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v3 with: submodules: true # Fetch Hugo themes (true OR recursive) fetch-depth: 0 # Fetch all history for .GitInfo and .Lastmod - name: Setup Hugo uses: peaceiris/actions-hugo@v2 with: hugo-version: \u0026#39;latest\u0026#39; # extended: true - name: Build run: hugo --minify - name: Deploy uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3 if: github.ref == \u0026#39;refs/heads/main\u0026#39; with: github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} publish_dir: ./public Now, the local working copy is ready for prototyping!\nCreate a new post and view it locally to test Hugo and your new theme.\nhugo new posts/HelloWorld.md echo \u0026#34;Hello World!\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; posts/HelloWorld.md hugo server -D Pro-Tip: you can draft content in Google Docs, then use a Markdown converter extension called ‚ÄúDocs to Markdown‚Äù.
