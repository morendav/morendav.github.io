If this algorithm excluded from its calculation the contribution from a target user, or if the database did not include any contribution from that target user, then as long as records in the database were independent it follows that within the scope of what can be revealed by that algorithm the target‚Äôs data stays a secret. Specifically, DP concerns itself with shrouding in uncertainty a target‚Äôs participation in the dataset that produced the output that was released.</p><p>DP algorithms are a class of algorithms that are derived from this intuition, and that carry a mathematical guarantee for the upper-bound privacy loss of each query or data release. This mathematical formulation was the culmination of decades of privacy research, which demonstrated that prior privacy preserving standards were leaky: with enough time and repeated releases it is infeasible to make any lasting guarantee about privacy. <sub><cite><sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup></cite></sub> This insight motivated the development of a new standard which stemmed from the <em>missing member in database</em> intuition and was presented in the seminal work by C. Dwork et al. ‚ÄúCalibrating Noise to Sensitivity in Private Data Analysis‚Äù. <sub><cite><sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup></cite></sub> In their work they introduced the mathematics to describe a DP algorithm, as well as a generalized approach to implementation which, in its original or derivative forms, has since become recognized as the gold standard for privacy preserving data transformations.</p><p>From an adversarial point of view, DP roughly means that for a given query output we would be uncertain (quantifiably so) that the output was derived from a database that did or did not contain a target user‚Äôs data. Paying homage to the cryptographic roots of privacy research and differential privacy, this is analogous to <em>semantic security</em> in a cryptosystem.</p><h2 id=why-was-dp-groundbreaking class=anchor-link><a href=#why-was-dp-groundbreaking>Why was DP groundbreaking?</a></h2><p>DP departed from previous attempts at generalized privacy preserving algorithms and standards notably with two characteristics:</p><ol><li>A quantification of the upper-bound privacy loss that might result for a data release</li><li>Formalization of the privacy loss for repeated data releases from the same source data</li></ol><p>The second of these observations is a result of DP being composable, this property allows data curators to set a global maximum privacy budget which is divided among the applications of the confidential data - the proof and practical interpretation on this later in this post.</p><p>Together, these new characteristics of the data processing mean that a system that adheres to the strict mathematical definition that is DP allows us to reason about and quantify the privacy risk against privacy attacks today as well as into the future. <sub><cite><sup id=fnref:3><a href=#fn:3 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>3</a></sup></cite></sub></p><h2 id=the-math-derivation-of-differential-privacy class=anchor-link><a href=#the-math-derivation-of-differential-privacy>The Math: Derivation of Differential Privacy</a></h2><p>is said to satisfy epsilon Differential Privacy (ŒµDP) <cite><sub><sup id=fnref1:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup></sub></cite></p><p>$$

There are a few potential transformations that satisfy this property, some popular mechanisms are <em>additive noise mechanisms</em> which sample noise from a distribution and inject that noise into the query response. Some popular additive noise mechanisms are:</p><h3 id=laplace-mechanism class=anchor-link><a href=#laplace-mechanism>Laplace Mechanism</a></h3><p>This mechanism is the canonical DP mechanism that satisfies Œµ-DP (Equation 01), and is otherwise known as ‚Äòpure differential privacy‚Äô. This mechanism samples noise from a zero-centered <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace_distribution>Laplace distribution</a> and injects this noise into the data release. <sub><cite><sup id=fnref2:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup></cite></sub></p><h3 id=gaussian-mechanism class=anchor-link><a href=#gaussian-mechanism>Gaussian Mechanism</a></h3><p>The Gaussian mechanism is very similar to the Laplace mechanism, except it uses a zero-centered, variance bound <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution>Guassian distribution</a> and does not satisfy Œµ-DP, instead it satisfies (Œµ, Œ¥) Differential Privacy (Equation 03). In addition to restrictions on the Noise-Distribution‚Äôs variance, this additive noise mechanism only holds true to (Œµ, Œ¥) DP when œµ &lt; 1.</p><h3 id=hammer-implementation-tips class=anchor-link><a href=#hammer-implementation-tips>:hammer: Implementation tips</a></h3><p>Differential Privacy is a powerful tool, while wielding it watch for:</p><ul><li><em><strong>Dimensions in the source data that are correlated</strong></em>: this leads to leaky privacy guarantees</li><li><em><strong>Extreme outliers in the data</strong></em>: users in the long tails of data are more identifiable, require more noise to mask. Consider binning data into ranges to address this. This is also the <a href=/blog/differential_privacy_laplace_01/#case_study_long_tail>subject of the case study</a></li></ul><h2 id=dp-with-privacy-budget-accounting class=anchor-link><a href=#dp-with-privacy-budget-accounting>DP with Privacy Budget Accounting</a></h2><p>Composition has been demonstrated for ŒµDP algorithms, which allows us to define a global limit on the maximum privacy loss that we will allow for a given dataset. When this global privacy loss is set, multiple queries are each assigned some portion of the whole budget. In other words, repeated queries <strong><em>deplete the global privacy budget</em></strong>.</p><p>Referring back to Equation 02 - note that for lower Œµ values we expect more uncertainty in which of the datasets the algorithm‚Äôs output came from D<sub>1</sub> or D<sub>2</sub>. As a generalization we have:</p><p><strong>Lower Œµ value:</strong></p><ul><li>Higher the noise we expect in the query response</li><li>Lower accuracy in the query response as a result of the noise</li><li>Better privacy story, but at the expense of the data utility</li></ul><h3 id=wrench-epsilon-setting-tips class=anchor-link><a href=#wrench-epsilon-setting-tips>:wrench: Œµ Setting Tips</a></h3><p>Fixing the global privacy budget means that <em><strong>care is needed when accounting for where to allocate higher accuracy queries</strong></em>, or where a sacrifice on accuracy may be made to stay within the budget.</p><p>In addition to careful accounting, <em><strong>cached answers can extend the budget</strong></em>. During the fulfillment of the query-response protocol: cache answers to queries, and retrieve cached answers when the same query is issued multiple times to the database. This type of response-replay won‚Äôt deplete the privacy budget, and ensures no additional information is learned about the data‚Äôs subjects for repeated queries.</p><hr><h1 id=case-study class=anchor-link><a href=#case-study>Case Study</a></h1><p>The following case study is <a href=https://github.com/morendav/pydp_laplace>hosted on GitHub</a>, which includes a Creative Commons licensed <a href=https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/parisrohan/credit-score-classification>dataset</a> (thanks Kaggle!).
